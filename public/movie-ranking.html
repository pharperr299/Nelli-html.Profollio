 <h3>The Road to Damarcas</h3>
    <p>This is my number 1 favourite movie. I love how Paul went from prosecuting God to serving him whole heartedly.</p>
 <h3>The Heart that Forgaves</h3>
    <p>My favourite christian movie. This movie teaches christians how to live and love again as a single parent in time of sorrow.</p>
 <h3>Love and Life</h3>
    <p>We all need a true friend like these 3 womens, i love this film<br />
     This movie follows three friends who stick out for one another throgh thick and thin.<br />
     It is a story of love, friendship and life.<br />
